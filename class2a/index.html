# Let's Talk Data

---

# The Value of Data
--

+ Data tells a story about something that's happened
--

+ Can describe the what happened directly or indirectly
--

???
+ Facilitators prompt students with the question "Why is data useful?" and/or "Why do we use it?"
+ Facilitators contrast this with the question "How would we make decisions without data?" to tease out the need for data to check assumptions and limited problem awareness
+ Facilitators carefully acknowledge that intuition, experience, and anecdotes can be useful but shouldn't be the sole source of knowledge and information

---

class: center,middle
# Are All Data Points Created Equal?
???
+ Facilitators lead a brief discussion of the issues with data
+ Issues to be touched on include: data entry errors, biases in data, data cleaning errors, etc.
---

class:middle
> Facts do not "speak for themselves." They speak for or against competing theories. Facts divorced from theory or visions are mere isolated curiosities.

##-Thomas Sowell *A Conflict of Visions*

???
+ Facilitators develop the theme of data skepticism by talking about the importance of context to understanding numbers provided in analysis
+ An example I often use is "What if I told you there's a 2% drop in crime? What do we need to know to make that number useful?"
+ Facilitator emphasizes that the goal of analysis is telling a true and compelling story, and communicating context whenever possible

+ Facilitator elaborates on the theme of data skepticism with the example of a GPS leading a driver into a pond or almost off a cliff to emphasize the need to keep awareness of context

+ Goal -> Discover patterns in the data
--

+ Understand the context
--

+ Summarize fields
--

+ Use graphical representations of the data
--

+ Explore outliers
