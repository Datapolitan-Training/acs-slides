# Holding Critical Conversations

---

class:center
# &nbsp;
# What are some of the things that can be difficult in critical conversations?
--

# What are some of the things we can do to manage those difficulties?

---

# Ground Rules
--

+ A simple set of norms
--

+ A contract between all of us to interact
--

+ We're going to set those norms now
--

+ Think about when you've been giving a critique and when you've been critiqued
--

+ Write down some things that you find important
--

+ If you need ideas, [check out this link](http://www.designkit.org/methods/28)
--

+ We'll discuss them as a group

---

# What is the Value of Evidence?
--

+ Validates (or invalidates) assumptions
--

+ Provides support for or against particular approaches or practices
--

+ Accumulation of evidence leads to a greater understanding

---

# What are Some Challenges with Evidence?
--

+ Gathering evidence isn't always easy
--

+ Conclusions not always clear
--

+ Hard to separate the facts from the assumptions

---

# Remember this?
> Facts do not "speak for themselves." They speak for or against competing theories. Facts divorced from theory or visions are mere isolated curiosities.

## -Thomas Sowell *A Conflict of Visions*

---

# Evidence-Based vs. Evidence-Informed
--

+ **Evidence-based** - approaches to prevention or treatment that are validated by some form of documented scientific evidence
--

+ **Evidence-informed** - use the best available practice knowledge to guide program design and implementation
--

+ What's the difference?

---

# Evidence-Based vs. Evidence-Informed

---

# Let's Talk About Research
--

+ We're going to be using the [Introduction and Guide to Research](http://www.nycstep.org/images/step/pdf/Introduction_and_GuidetoResearch25Feb2017.pdf)
--

+ We're going to split up the sections of the guide
--

+ In your groups, you're going to take the section and teach the rest of the class

---

# Article Review
--

+ We have a few articles for you all to read
--

+ You can find them on [the STEP website](http://www.nycstep.org/step3)
--

+ Take an article and go through the 12 questions from Page 3 of the guide
--

+ Assess the article and be prepared to defend your assessment

---

# Journaling
--

+ Take a moment to reflect on what we just did
--

+ What are the critical research topics for your project?
--

+ Is your project more evidence-based or evidence-informed? Why?
--

+ What challenges do you expect with gathering research for your project?

# What's the Problem?

# Let's Do This For Your Projects

---

# Root Cause Analysis
![img-right-25](../images/ideate_discuss_decide_crop.png)
--

+ On your own, write down the key research topics for your project
--

+ Go for quantity, not quality
--

+ Reflect over what you have and try and organize them in terms of importance
--

+ Discuss these with your group
--

+ Try to go deeper into the topics
--

![img-center-25](../images/no_jargon.png)

---

class:center,middle
# Present Your Key Topics

---

# Open Lab
--

+ Check in with your Project Overview from Session 1 ([GABI](../images/overview/GABI.jpg), [Children's Center](../images/overview/ChildrensCenter.jpg), [Supervision Until 21](../images/overview/SupervisionUntil21.jpg), [Timely Adequate Matching](../images/overview/TimelyAdequateMatching.jpg))
--

+ Look over the research questions
--

+ Start your research into the topics you identified
--

+ Look over the resources on the [NYC STEP website](http://www.nycstep.org/digdeeper)
--

+ Also look at the [University of Michigan Library Staying Informed for Social Work Practice Guide](http://guides.lib.umich.edu/c.php?g=283012&p=1885683)

> A hypothesis is only as good as the research behind it.
- Dominic Cappello

---

# Homework
--

+ Continue your research and data analysis
--

+ We'll give you time tomorrow to do both
