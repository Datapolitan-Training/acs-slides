# Logic Models
--

+ A visual diagram of key program components
--

+ Useful in planning public service initiatives
--

+ The key components we'll be using are:
--
<br>Hypothesis
--
<br>Purpose
--
<br>Goals
--
<br>Inputs/Partners
--
<br>Activities
--
<br>Evaluation measures
--
<br>Outcomes

---

# Hypothesis
--

+ A clear statement of what will result with the change in practice
--

+ The hypothesis frames the entire innovation or initiative
--

+ Example<br><br>_If we provide a collaborative referral (also called a "warm hand off") to parents—working with them as they identify service providers—we will have higher rates of parents engaging with those services_


---

# Purpose
--

+ Relates the hypothesis to the broader context
--

+ Fits the project into larger issues, challenges, or questions
--

+ Example<br><br>_Higher rates of parent engagement will improve outcomes for families_

---

# Goals
--

+ Specific elements that make up the general purpose
--

+ Logic model goals can be targets but do not have to be specific and measurable
--

+ They can also be items thought to contribute to the problem you are addressing in your purpose statement
--

+ Examples
--
<br>_Increase parent engagement rate by 20%_
--
<br>_Increase parent satisfaction with referral services_
--

+ It's okay if you don't yet know just how you're going to do all of the above; that's where the logic model comes in

---

# Inputs and Partners
--

+ All the things (and people) related to both the problem and the (potential) solution
--

+ Inputs are resources for your innovation
--

+ Some Examples
--
<br>_Program Data_
--
<br>_Colleagues_
--
<br>_Clients_
--
<br>_Community Partners_
--
<br>_STEP Coaches_

---

# Activities
--

+ The specific steps/actions that move your innovation forward
--

+ Should be performed by, about, with, or "to" the inputs
--

+ Each input should be linked to at least one activity

---

# Evaluation Measures 
--

+ The key indicators to evaluate your project
--

+ Tell the story of your project and the impact you had
--

+ Should be quantifiable in some way


---

# Evaluation Measures 
--

![img-center-70](../images/bad_metric.png)

---

# Outcomes
--

+ What you expect will happen as a result of your activities
--

+ We use short-term (2-6 months), intermediate (6-12 months), and long-term (1-2 years)
--

+ Short-term outcomes are generally "individual-level" outcomes (staff, stakeholders, and/or clients)
--

+ Intermediate outcomes are generally "agency-level" outcomes (practice and procedures)
--

+ Long-term outcomes are generally larger outcomes that realize your project goals (culture and environment)

---

# Outcomes vs Outputs
--

+ Outcomes are the larger results you're trying to manifest
--

+ Outputs are the tangible elements of your outcome
--

+ Ask this question: "Can I prove that this happened due to an activity we did, and not because of something else?"
--
<br>If Yes, it is an output.
--
 If No, it is an outcome.
--

+ Example
--
<br>You are holding survey results in your hand that came from the survey you administered (output)
--
<br>Your coworkers reported better job morale in a follow-up survey (outcome)
