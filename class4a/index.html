# Logic Models
--

+ A visual diagram of key program components
--

+ Useful in planning for public health and other public service initiatives
--

+ The key components we'll be using are: hypothesis, purpose, goals, inputs/partners, activities, evaluation measures, and outcomes

---

# Hypothesis
--

+ A clear statement of what will result with the change in practice
--

+ The hypothesis frames the entire innovation or initiative
--

+ Example<br><br>_If we provide a collaborative referral (also called a "warm hand off") to parents—working with them as they identify service providers—we will have higher rates of parents engaging with those services_


---

# Purpose
--

+ Relates the hypothesis to the broader context
--

+ Fits the project into larger issues, challenges, or questions
--

+ Example<br><br>_Higher rates of parent engagement will improve outcomes for families_

---

# Goals
--

+ Specific elements that make up the general purpose
--

+ Logic model goals can be targets but do not have to be specific and measurable
--

+ They can also be items thought to contribute to the problem you are addressing in your purpose statement
--

+ Examples<br>_Increase parent engagement rate by 20%_<br>_Increase parent satisfaction with referral services_
--

+ It's okay if you don't yet know just how you're going to do all of the above; that's where the logic model comes in

---

# Inputs/Partners
Put very simply, inputs are all the things (and people) that you currently have that are related to both the problem and the (potential) solution. Even when they are ostensibly linked to the challenge you're addressing, inputs are still resources.

Again using the above example, the office staff you want to retain (even though some may contribute to the problem) are considered inputs—because it is hoped the same staff will be part of the solution. Clients who constantly come back into the system and contribute to a high repeat maltreatment rate (part of the "problem") are also inputs in your innovation and can be part of the solution.

More obvious inputs are management teams you report to; STEP instructors, coaches, and participants; data sources used to track the challenge; existing research about the problem; coworkers; external partners and stakeholders; and other tangible or technological supports.

If your project requires inputs or resources that don't yet exist, you will need to identify activities to obtain them

---

# Activities
Activities are the specific steps/actions that move your innovation forward and should be performed by, about, with, or "to" the inputs. Each of the inputs in your logic model should be linked in some way to at least one activity.

An activity for the staff retention challenge discussed above may be an employee survey to discover areas of concern related to work conditions and office climate/culture. This may be created by the RAD Bureau (Input A); administered by the COM (Input B) to the rest of the office (Input C); and shared with STEP coaches and colleagues (Input D). The team may discuss the survey results within the context of an academic research article about similar issues (Input E).

# Evaluation Measures 
--

![img-center-70](../images/bad_metric.png)

---

# Outcomes
In a logic model, outcomes—short-term, intermediate, and long-term—are the sequential changes (and, we hope, improvements) that you expect will happen as a result of your activities and outputs.

Short-term outcomes generally should occur within 2-6 months (or less or more, depending on your project) and may be described as "individual-level" outcomes. These types of changes might involve staff, stakeholders, and/or clients, and probably won't go beyond changes in knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, behaviors; or small changes in workflow, practice, or protocols. An example of a short-term, individual-level outcome (again using the staff retention example) might be: Greater willingness among some staff to participate in a team-building activity once per month.

Intermediate outcomes will likely take between 6 months and 2 years to appear and are sometimes called "agency-level" outcomes. With ongoing application of your innovation or initiative, you may start to see improvements in the "target numbers" related to your overall challenge at this point. Intermediate outcomes may also include consistent use of a new practice (an all-new "business as usual"); stronger relationships with stakeholders; and secondary gains (or unintended consequences) related to your innovation, such as improved workplace morale or need for more resources.

Long-term outcomes should relate most closely with the stated goal(s) of your logic model. These outcomes may take 2 years or more to materialize but should be well-established and consistent. At this point, if your innovation has continued apace, you should hope to see positive changes in your specific challenge area and possibly improvements in related areas.

---

# Outcomes vs Outputs
Making the distinction between outputs and outcomes is easy in theory, but as you start to build your logic model it may feel murky at times. A good way to know for sure whether something is an output vs. an outcome is to ask this question: "Can I prove that this happened due to an activity we did, and not because of something else?" If the answer is yes (such as, you are holding survey results in your hand that came from the survey you administered), it is an output. If the answer is no (such as, your coworkers reported better job morale in a follow-up survey)... it is an outcome.
